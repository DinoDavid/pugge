Flashcards for the terminal

The need for flashcards arose because of a multiple choice test.
I want a simple format and minimalistic interface.
Also, I wanted to hone my C skills.

## The name
Pronounce it how you want.
You may say **pug-e**, like the dog type pug and the character Wall-E.
The norwegian pronounciation is almost like **poo-guh**.
